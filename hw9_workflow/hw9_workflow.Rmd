### Background
The WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial tested the hypothesis that improvements to household sanitation could reduce linear growth faltering in the first two years of life (Luby et al., 2018). 

### Hypothesis
Children whose household has an improved latrine have higher length-for-age Z-scores than those in households without improved latrines.

### Methods

- Data source
- Study design
- Time points / sub population examined
- Exposure definition
- Outcome definition
- Statistical methods

### Results

#### Figure 1. Histogram of height-for-age z-score 

Description of histogram to be added

```{r histogram, echo=FALSE, out.width=400}
laz_histogram
```

#### Box plot of height-for-age z-score by household ownership of an improved latrine

Description of boxplot to be added

```{r boxplot, echo=FALSE, out.width=400}
laz_lat_boxplot
```


#### Table 1. Mean difference and risk ratio 

Description of results to be added

```{r results, echo = FALSE}
table = data.frame(Outcome = c(rep("Length-for-age z-score",2), "Stunting"), 
  Measure = c(rep("Mean difference", 2), "Risk ratio"),
  Model = c("Unadjusted", "Adjusted", "Unadjusted"),
  Estimate= c(laz_unadj_moa, laz_adj_moa, 
                          stunt_unadj_moa))

kable(table, format = "markdown")

```

### Conclusions
Comparison of results from the main WASH Benefits study and this analysis to be added
