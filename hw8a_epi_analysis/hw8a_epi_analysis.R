# NOTE: In this homework, in order for the autograder
# to run correctly, you must run the code for each
# problem in order. If you have trouble with the 
# autograder, try running your code again starting 
# from line 10.

# this analysis

CheckProblem1()

#-----------------------------------------------
# Problem 2: Read in the three required datasets 
# for this analysis and name them as follows: 

# treatment: washb-bangladesh-tr-public.csv
# enroll: washb-bangladesh-enrol-public.csv
# anthro: washb-bangladesh-anthro-public.csv

#-----------------------------------------------
# Problem 7: Make a variable called “implatrine” 
# in the all data frame that is a factor variable
# equal to "Has improved latrine" if the household owns 
# a latrine with a functional water seal and equal
# to "Does not have improved latrine" if they do not. 
# If the value for latseal is missing, code the 
# implatrine variable as "Does not have improved latrine".

#-----------------------------------------------
# Problem 9: Create a histogram showing the 
# distribution of the length-for-age

#-----------------------------------------------
# Problem 9b: Examine the distribution in the histogram
# you created. What do you conclude about the 
# nutritional status of children in this study 
# at endline? Recall that children who have LAZ< -2
# are considered to be "stunted" (ie, shorter than
# is considered normal for their age and sex). 

# Write 1-2 sentences including line breaks, and use
# the "hash" symbol (#) at the beginning of each line
# to comment out your answer.

#-----------------------------------------------
# Problem 10: Create a box plot for the length-for-age 
# Z-score within categories of implatrine. Label

# "laz_lat_boxplot".
