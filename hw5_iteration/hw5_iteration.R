# Let's load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# This assignment uses data from the WASH Benefits
# Bangladesh trial. The trial assessed whether 
# water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition 
# interventions delivered separately or together
# could reduce child diarrhea and/or improve child
# growth. See Luby et al. 2018 for full details 
# (doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/)

# In this problem set we will calculate the incidence 
# density of diarrhea in different treatment arms after the 
# interventions were delivered. 

# The data and codebooks are publicly available here: 
# https://osf.io/pqzj5/

# Load the diarrhea dataset:
d = read.csv(paste0(here::here(),"/data/washb-data/washb-bangladesh-diar-public.csv"))

# Load the dataset with treatment variables: 
tr = read.csv(paste0(here::here(),"/data/washb-data/washb-bangladesh-tr-public.csv"))

# Next let's merge the two datasets together.
# This will allow us to calculate the prevalence
# of diarrhea in different treatment arms 
# (e.g., water, sanitation, handwashing, etc.)

d_tr = left_join(d, tr, by=c("block","clusterid"))

# Now let's filter to only keep the rows for diarrhea
# measurements after the interventions were delivered. 
# The svy variable includes values 0, 1, 2. We are going
# to drop the 0 values, which indicate the time period
# before interventions were delivered. 
d_tr = d_tr %>% filter(svy!=0)

# Now we are going to drop children with missing values 
# in the diarrhea variable from the dataset. This 
# assumes that they were missing at random - i.e., 
# that there are no characteristics associated with whether
# a child was missing diarrhea measurement. 
d_tr = d_tr %>% filter(!is.na(diar7d))

# Take a look at the merged dataset:
head(d_tr)


#-----------------------------------------------
# Problem 1: Calculate the diarrhea prevalence in  
# each treatment arm. As a reminder, the diarrhea
# status is saved in the variable diar7d. 
# Save the results in an object
# called prevalence_tr. It should have 7 rows (one
# for each treatment) and two columns. The first 
# column should be for the treatment name and the
# second should be for the prevalence. 

# (Hint: you did this in the homework assignment 
# called hw_prev, and you can use the same code)

prevalence_tr = "<<<<<<<<<<<<< YOUR CODE HERE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>"

# Check your answer
CheckProblem1()

#------------------------------------
# Problem 2: Write a function that converts
# prevalence to incidence density. Assume 
# that the disease is rare. The function should
# be called calculate_inc_rare. It should take
# two arguments for prevalence (prev) and duration (d)
# of disease. It should return the estimated
# incidence density in person-days. You only need
# to write a function in this problem - you 
# don't need to calculate anything yet. 

# Note: the autograder will only check that
# you defined a function with the correct name
# and that the arguments are named correctly.

#------------------------------------
# Problem 3: Using dplyr (and not a foor loop), 
# add a column to the data frame
# prevalence_tr that has the incidence density
# in each arm assuming that the duration is 5 days.
# Use the function calculate_inc_rare to 
# estimate the incidence density and name the column 
# incidence_density

#------------------------------------
# Problem 4: Using dplyr (and not a for loop), 
# calculate the incidence density difference
# (incidence density in each intervention arm minus 
# the incidence density in the control arm). 
# Save results in a column called inc_diff 
# in the data frame prevalence_tr. 
#------------------------------------
# To get you started, here is code to save
# the incidence density in the control arm as 
# a scalar. You can subtract this scalar from the
# incidence density in each treatment arm. 
control_inc = prevalence_tr %>% 
  filter(tr=="Control") %>%
  select(incidence)
control_inc = as.vector(control_inc$incidence)

# calculate the incidence difference in each arm 
prevalence_tr = "<<<<<<<<<<<<< YOUR CODE HERE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>"

# Check your answer
CheckProblem4()

#------------------------------------
# Problem 5: Using a for loop (and not dplyr), 
# calculate the incidence density difference
# (incidence density in each intervention arm minus 
# the incidence density in the control arm). 
# Save results in a vector called inc_diff_loop.
# Hint: the length of the vector should be 6.
# Do not include the control arm in the vector.

# The purpose of this problem is to show you 
# that there is more than one way to do the same
# thing in R. This is an example of a situation
# in which most R users would probably prefer to 
# use dplyr, but for your learning purposes, it is
# helpful to practice using a loop to see the pros
# and cons of each approach.

# Problem 6: Optional challenge question!

# In the data frame d_tr, columns d3plus2d through tooth7d 
# contain indicators for whether each child
# experienced those symptoms in the past 7 days
# or the past 2 days. 

# Write a for loop to take the mean of each of those 
# columns, and save the results in a vector called
# symptoms. When taking the mean, you will need to 
# use the option na.rm=TRUE in order to ignore
# missing values when calculating the mean.

# There is more than one way to approach this problem.
