# NOTE: In this homework, in order for the autograder
# to run correctly, you must run the code for each
# problem in order. If you have trouble with the 
# autograder, try running your code again starting 
# from line 12.

# Let's load the dplyr and tidyr packages
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Load the data for this assignment
load(paste0("data/hw7_relational_data.RData"))

# This homework will focus on a hypothetical study 
# of children under 10 years of age. You are the data
# analyst, and your task is to explore the 
# pattern of infection with cryptosporidium, a 
# type of parasite, by age in years and sex. You must also 
# assess whether cryptosporidium infection is 
# associated with diarrhea symptoms. 

# The study collected a baseline survey at enrollment 
# and recorded participant age and sex. At three time points,
# it collected a stool sample from participants and
# tested for cryptosporidium infection. These infections
# can be both symptomatic and asymptomatic, and
# among symptomatic infections, diarrhea is a common
# symptom. The study also conducted follow-up surveys
# at the three time points and recorded diarrhea symptoms
# at the time of the stool sample collection. 

# The baseline dataset contains information on age and sex. 
head(baseline)

# The lab_data dataset contains the cryptosporidium test
# results. In each column starting with "crypto", a zero
# value indicates a negative test results, a 1 value indicates
# a positive result. Some samples were lost or could not
# be analyzed and have missing values. 
head(lab_data)

# The fu_survey dataset contains the results of the follow-up
# surveys. In each column starting with "diarrhea", a zero
# value indicates no diarrhea symptoms, a 1 value indicates
# diarrhea symptoms. If the patient's stool sample was lost
# at that time point, no symptoms were recorded, so there is
# a missing value in those cells. 
head(fu_survey)

#-----------------------------------------------
# Problem 1: Estimate the prevalence of cryptosporidium 
# at each time point using dplyr. Save your results
# in a data frame called prev_time with 1 row and 3 columns.
# The columns should be named "crypto_prev1", "crypto_prev2", 
# "crypto_prev3". You can obtain the prevalence by taking the mean of
# the crypto variables. Be sure to ignore missings when
# taking the mean.

#-----------------------------------------------
# Your next task is to estimate the prevalence of 
# cryptosporidium pooling across all time points. 

# Problem 2: To do this, you will need to convert 
# the lab_data data frame from wide to long format. 
# Create a long format dataset called lab_data_long
# that contains 30 rows (10 participants x 3 time 
# points). The columns will be for id, time point, 
# and crypto test result. Label these columns
# "id", "time", and "crypto".

# Problem 3: Now use lab_data_long to estimate the
# prevalence of cryptosporidium pooling across all 
# time points. Save results in a data frame called
# prev. It will contain one column and one row. 
# Name the column crypto_prev.

#-----------------------------------------------
# Next you are interested in assessing whether
# age is associated with crypto infection. Specifically
# we want to know whether the prevalence is higher
# among children <5 years vs 5 years or older. 

# Problem 4: To assess this, you will need to join 
# the baseline and lab_data_long data frames. 
# Answer this multiple choice question by entering
# "a", "b" etc into p4: 

# a) Full_join is the appropriate type of join
# b) Inner_join is the appropriate type of join
# c) Full_join or inner_join are appropriate
#    and give the same answer
# d) Any of the mutating joins are appropriate 
#    and give the same answer

# Problem 5: To assess this, you will need to join 
# the baseline and lab_data_long data frames. 
# Use the join of your choice to join them and 
# save the resulting data frame with the name
# baseline_lab_long. It should have columns for id, 
# time, age, female, and crypto, and 30 rows.

# Check your answer

#-----------------------------------------------
# Problem 6: Now add a column to the data frame 
# baseline_lab_long called age_u5 that contains 
# 1 if the age is <5 and 0 if the age is 5 or older. 

# Hint: use the ifelse function. For example, if you want
# to make a variable called age_u10 equal to 1
# if the child is under 10 and 0 if they are over 10, 
# you would use ifelse as follows when defining
# the variable: ifelse(age < 10, 1, 0)

# Problem 7: Next, calculate the prevalence of crypto
# among children <5 years and those 5 or older. 
# Use dplyr and save results in a data frame called
# prev_age. It should contain two rows (one for age <5
# and one for age >=5) and two columns, one for age_u5

# Problem 12: To prepare to merge the fu_survey_long

# time as a key when merging the two data frames. 
# Modify the lab_data_long data frame's time column. For example, 
# replace "crypto_time1" with "1" and so on. You can
# use nested ifelse functions to achieve this.
